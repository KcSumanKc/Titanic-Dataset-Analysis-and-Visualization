# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis-and-Visualization

The successful completion of the project was facilitated through the utilization of several key Python Programming Language libraries, namely pandas and plotly graph objects, alongside the valuable contribution of plotly express, all within the framework of a Jupyter notebook. A meticulous data cleaning process was implemented, addressing each column of the dataset to ensure its integrity and quality. Following the comprehensive data cleaning, an insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase was conducted. This EDA encompassed the creation of diverse chart types, including line, bar, donut, histogram, and scatter plots, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's nuances. The charts that were generated played a pivotal role in unveiling noteworthy patterns and trends that were embedded within the dataset, thereby enriching the overall analysis.
